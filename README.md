Cybersecurity Bootcamp Final project (Pentesting, Wireshark), University of Sydney, 2021.
The objective was to act as a pentester and SOC analyst.

* Implement alarms and thresholds in Elasticsearch Watcher.
* Find vulnerabilities / exploits to gain access to a vulnerable WordPress site / server.
* Use Wireshark to analyze and find malicious traffic on the wire.
* Create a team presentation with the assessment, analysis and hardening of the vulnerable system.
